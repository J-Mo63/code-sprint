# CodeSprint
CodeSprint is a multiplayer coding trivia platform for **Android** that helps users learn through coding challenges made to be done fast.
This project was done as a part of a major uni project in **31285 Mobile Applications Development** and was never released to the Google Play Store (mostly because I couldnt be bothered to write more questions) and is currently unmaintained.
